## **About the App**

This app uses the ***<font color=\"Crimson\">Happiness and Alcohol Consumption</font>*** data set obtained from **Kaggle** to build a linear regression model for observing the average happiness score of individuals across 122 countries, as a function of consumption of different alcoholic beverages as well as the Human Development Index(HDI).

The plots created are not particularly useful for making predictions, but can be used for observing and understanding the trends in and the structure of the data set.

## **Description of the Data**

- This data set aims to explore the happiness levels of individuals based off of their **<font color=\"Crimson\">per capita consumption of alcoholic beverages</font>** , **<font color=\"Crimson\">Human Development Index(HDI)</font>** and GDP.  

- Happiness Score is measured on a **<font color=\"Crimson\">scale of 1-10</font>** with 10 being the happiest. The data set shows the **<font color=\"Crimson\">average</font>** happiness score indicated by the country's residents.  

- The HDI used is provided by the United Nations. Further, the region and hemisphere of each country has been specified. The unit for per capita consumption of beverages is **Liters**. Again, the country wise average is shown.
