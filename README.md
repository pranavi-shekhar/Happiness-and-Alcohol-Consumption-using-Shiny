# Happiness-and-Alcohol-Consumption-using-Shiny

- This repository contains the **server.R** and **ui.R** codes for the shiny application linked below.
- The Shiny app uses the **Happiness and Alcohol Consumption** data set obtained from **Kaggle** to build a linear regression model for observing the average happiness score of individuals across 122 countries, as a function of consumption of different alcoholic beverages as well as the Human Development Index(HDI).
- The data used for the app is provided in the repository ( **alcohol.csv** )
- Link to the App's Documentation (also available in the application itself) on my [RPubs](https://pranavi-shekhar.github.io/Happiness-and-Alcohol-Consumption-using-Shiny/App-Documentation.html)
- The app's reproducible pitch can be found on my **[RPubs](https://rpubs.com/pranavi/644668)**
- The Shiny application can be found **[here](https://pranavi-shekhar.shinyapps.io/Happiness-and-Alcohol-Consumption/)**
